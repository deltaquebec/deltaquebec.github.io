_"Farewell happy fields_

_Where joy for ever dwells: Hail horrors, hail_

_Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell_

_Receive thy new possessor: One who brings_

_A mind not to be changed by place or time._

_The mind is its own place, and in itself_

_Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven."_

Book I, Lines 249-255

_“Me miserable! Which way shall I fly_

_Infinite wrath and infinite despair?_

_Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell;_

_And in the lowest deep a lower deep,_

_Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,_

_To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.”_

Book IV, Lines 73-78
